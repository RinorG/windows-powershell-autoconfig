# windows-powershell-autoconfig

## What is it?

It is a *NodeJS* Project which updates your **powershell** and **oh-my-posh** scripts. 

## Why should I use it?

It is very convenient if:
- you work on more than one computer
- your computer lost the data on the main drive
- you bought/built a new computer

## Make sure:

- that you installed **oh-my-posh**!
- that you installed **powershell** !**WARNING:** NOT WINDOWS POWERSHELL!

**Feel free to fork and set up for yourself!**
